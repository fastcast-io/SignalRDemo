# SignalRDemo
Playing with signal r asp.net core 3
 
It's a little demo adapted from the tutorial. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr?tabs=visual-studio&view=aspnetcore-3.0

Just run the solution (and open the console log if you want, I left some logs)
Now go on the <whatever_the_localhost_is_here>/session page (and open the console log as well if you wanna see my logs)

It will help to open both tabs (index and the session) side by side. 

Then put any session code in the session page's input box and click either the start or end session.
(It should be reflected in the console if it is open)
You will notice no changes on the index side

Now try and put 42 as the session code. It will be reflected in the index page. 
It will update the div showing if the session is active or not!
